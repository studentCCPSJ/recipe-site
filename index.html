    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Melt the butter over high heat in a heavy pot, like a Dutch oven, and add the oil. </li>
      <li>Stir together in this pot, once the butter is melted, the carrots, onions, and salt. Sautee on relatively high heat until soft.</li>
      <li>Trim and chop the chicken thighs into small chunks, and add them into the pot. Throw in the remaining salt and the bay leaves. Season with black pepper, and sautée the chicken until golden.</li>
      <li>Increase heat to high, and add about one cup of white wine. Reduce, scraping the bottom until most of the wine is gone.</li>
      <li>Right when you start hearing and smelling the bottom begin to brown, pour in the broth and begin scraping the bottom so that nothing burns. Add the rice.</li>
      <li>Leaving the root intact, chop off the end of the garlic head, and set it into the pot. Bring to a rolling boil, before lowering the heat and simmering until the rice is to the desired texture.</li>
      <li>Pull it all off the heat, remove the garlic and bay leaves. Add the remainder of the butter, the parsley, and the parmesan.</li>
      <li>Plate, and optionally top with grated parsley.</li>
    </ol>
