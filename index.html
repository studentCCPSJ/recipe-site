    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Melt the butter over high heat in a heavy pot, like a Dutch oven, and add the oil. </li>
      <li>Stir together in this pot, once the butter is melted, the carrots, onions, and salt. Sautee on relatively high heat until soft.</li>
      <li>Trim and chop the chicken thighs into small chunks, and add them into the pot. Throw in the remaining salt and the bay leaves. Season with black pepper, and saut√©e the chicken until golden.</li>
      <li>Increase heat to high, and add about one cup of white wine. Reduce, scraping the bottom until most of the wine is gone.</li>
      <li>Right when you start hearing and smelling the bottom begin to brown, pour in the broth and begin scraping the bottom so that nothing burns. Add the rice.</li>
      <li>Leaving the root intact, chop off the end of the garlic head, and set it into the pot. Bring to a rolling boil, before lowering the heat and simmering until the rice is to the desired texture.</li>
      <li>Pull it all off the heat, remove the garlic and bay leaves. Add the remainder of the butter, the parsley, and the parmesan.</li>
      <li>Plate, and optionally top with grated parsley.</li>
    </ol>
